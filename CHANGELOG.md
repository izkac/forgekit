## Unreleased

### Forge runtime integrity — round 2 (product-loop acceptance)

- **Spine matrix**: `forge spine init|check` — per-change `spine.json` mapping capability → library → runtime owner → writes → reads → UI consumer → evidence. Library-only rows fail validation.
- **Deferral registry**: `forge defer add|resolve|list` — "wiring later" must name a registered open task; unresolved deferrals block done. Reviewers reject unregistered deferrals.
- **`forge integrity-check`**: mechanical gate (spine validity, open deferrals, product-loop/BLOCKED evidence) — run automatically by `forge phase finish|done`.
- **E2E redefined as product loop**: producer→consumer→decision-changes-output; a single job slice or library E2E no longer counts. `verify-evidence.md` needs a `## Product loop` section (or explicit BLOCKED, which refuses done).
- **Job-kind closure**: every product-surface job kind wired end-to-end or deleted before complete; "fail closed" is only a temporary BLOCKED state.
- **Consumer–producer rule**: anything UI/API reads must be proven production-written.
- Prompts/phases updated: plan scaffolds the spine; task reviewer rejects unregistered deferrals and library-only spine rows; final reviewer requires product-loop evidence.

### Forge runtime integrity

- Always-on rules: `skills/forge/references/runtime-integrity.md` (no stubs / false success, runtime owner required, tests must fail on a no-op, specs beat narrow tasks, E2E-or-BLOCKED).
- Hardened implementer / task-reviewer / final-reviewer prompts; plan orchestration seam; verify wiring audit + E2E gate.
- Pace `auto` fails closed to **standard** for unrecognized scope; worker/job/queue/pipeline/etl/platform/orchestration/openspec signals → standard; explicit small-work → brisk.
- Task-count escalation: `--tasks-total ≥ 15` upgrades brisk/lite → standard when pace is not pinned.
- `forge phase finish|done` requires `verify-evidence.md` and all tasks complete (escape: `--allow-incomplete "<reason>"`).
- Defaults: `integrity.forbidStubs`, `specsBeatNarrowTasks`, `requireE2E`; session reminders inject integrity line.
- **Upgrade:** re-run `forgekit install --skills forge --force` on each machine to pick up skill changes.
